# Boolean blindness

## Pros
- Less types to define (boiler plate)
- Loss of stand functions that work on Boolean (we lose the API of the standard types)

## Cons
- Easier to make mistakes
- Values are not checked by the compiler


### More of the same
- Int (ports, buffer sizes, time)
- Strings (names, values, quantities etc)
- Option (to represent Booleans, instead of presence and absence of a value)
- Either (to present a choice of any two values, instead of errors and valid values)
- Pairs (Just a joining of multiple types without specifying their relationship)
- List (???)
